If you **modify** Quote.Vote *and* make those modifications available to
others over a network (SaaS, intranet, public site):

1. Publish the full corresponding source code of your version  
   – a public Git repo or a download link is fine.
2. Keep this LICENSE file and notices intact.
3. State your changes (recommended).

Running the unmodified upstream build requires no extra action.
